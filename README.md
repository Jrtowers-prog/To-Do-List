# To-Do-List

I created a to-do list in C++ (Qt framework for GUI) with the functionality I need to keep myself organised.

It includes the typical to-do list features aswell as file saving, allowing you to create your list at the start of the day and send that file to all the devices you will be using. 

You can also create multiple lists in advance for the week if you wish.
